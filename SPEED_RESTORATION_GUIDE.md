# 🚀 Speed Restoration Guide

Your bot's upload speed has been significantly reduced due to **missing performance dependencies** and **overly conservative settings**. Here's what was wrong and how to fix it:

## 🔍 Issues Found

### Missing Performance Dependencies
- ❌ **uvloop** - High-performance event loop (2-4x speed boost)
- ❌ **aiofiles** - Asynchronous file operations  
- ❌ **aiodns** - Faster DNS resolution
- ❌ **psutil** - System resource monitoring

### Conservative Performance Settings
- 🐌 **Download Limit**: Only 5 simultaneous downloads (now increased to 12)
- 🐌 **File Size Limit**: 45MB max (now increased to 100MB)
- 🐌 **Chunk Size**: 8MB chunks (now increased to 16MB)
- 🐌 **Fragments**: 12 concurrent (now increased to 20)

## 🛠️ How to Fix (Both Replit & Render)

### Step 1: Install Performance Dependencies

**For Replit:**
```bash
python3 speed_fix.py
```

**For Render:**
Add these to your `requirements.txt`:
```
uvloop==0.19.0
aiofiles==23.2.1  
aiodns==3.1.1
psutil==5.9.8
```

### Step 2: Update Your Files

Copy these updated files from this Replit to your Render deployment:
- `modules/ultra_fast_downloader.py` (increased concurrent downloads)
- `modules/utils.py` (improved download settings)
- `requirements.txt` (performance dependencies)

### Step 3: Restart Your Bot

**Replit:** Bot will auto-restart
**Render:** Redeploy your service

## 📊 Expected Speed Improvements

After applying these fixes, you should see:
- ⚡ **2-4x faster** async operations (uvloop)
- 📁 **Faster file I/O** (aiofiles)
- 🌐 **Faster DNS lookups** (aiodns)
- 🔄 **2.4x more concurrent downloads** (5→12)
- 💾 **2x larger chunks** (8MB→16MB)
- 🧩 **1.7x more fragments** (12→20)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Both deployments need fixing** - Apply changes to both Replit and Render
2. **Restart required** - Changes only take effect after restart
3. **Memory usage** - Monitor memory usage on Render (512MB limit)
4. **Same files** - Make sure both deployments use the same optimized files

## 🔧 Quick Test

After fixing, your bot logs should show:
```
✅ uvloop activated for enhanced performance
✅ aiofiles available for streaming downloads  
✅ aiodns activated for faster DNS resolution
🚀 Using optimized built-in downloader for stability
```

Instead of:
```
⚠️ uvloop not available, using default event loop
⚠️ aiofiles not available, using fallback methods
⚠️ aiodns not available, using default resolver
```

Your upload speeds should now be back to their original performance! 🎉
